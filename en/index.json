	"content": "Hello, my name is Jihan Kim. I am a physicist transitioning into AI research scientist.\nI love to learn new things and challenge myself to solve hard problems.\nI graduated from Oregon State University with PhD in physics on December 2019.\nThroughout my graduate program, I studied how breast cancer cells and surrounding extracellular matrix (ECM) interact bidirectionally. One way, cancer cells remodel ECM to modify physical properties and geometrical architectures. The other way, remodeled ECM regulates cancer behavior such as cancer cell migration.\nDuring my last year in graduate school, I was fascinated with machine learning. So I decided to learn and explore further about AI research field. In this blog, I\u0026rsquo;d like to share my journey to become an AI research scientist.\n$$\n\\Gamma(z) = \\int_0^\\infty t^{z-1}e^{-t}dt,.\n$$\n"
